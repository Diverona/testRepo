## Briefly about me ##

I have a technical education and good experience in achieving my goals.

I used to work as a self employer selling commercial furniture. I organized my own online store and was a partner in a small furniture manufacture. Right now the situation in my country is unstable and I want to be able to work from anywhere. So I decided to learn programming.
I started by studying HTML and CSS on Youtube courses. And now I am taking online courses in Rolling Scopes School.

## Skills: ##

- HTML5, CSS3;
- Git, GitHub;
- CMS Opencart; 
- Photoshop;
- SEO.

## Code example ##

```javascript
function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b
}
```

## Experience ##
I have some layout experience with my web-site https://nova-mebel.com. I did simple edits myself and hired a programmer to work with scripts.
